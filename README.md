# smbc DR
A simple visualization of text [sourced/scraped](https://github.com/Kelvin-Lee/smbc-with-casperjs) from smbc-comics.com using D3.js

## Notes
- Currently, the input text file is 4k lines long, but only about 500 are worth parsing for English words.
- The input text file was generated in mid July 2015, so it will not have **all** of the content that is on smbc-comics. Just a good chunk.
